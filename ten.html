i think about dema more than i should.
the walls were high, but the walls were all i knew.
they taught us to look down, not forward.
to walk in lines, to follow the drag of those before us.

every step was supposed to mean something.
every breath was borrowed, every thought was monitored.
we weren’t people—we were vessels waiting to be filled.

sometimes i wonder if i’m still carrying those walls inside me.
even here, far away, i feel their weight.
like i never truly left.

but i did.
i escaped.
