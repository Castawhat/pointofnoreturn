    <pre>
i can’t stop thinking about dema.
the walls, the towers, the streets Lined with Eyes that never blinked.
i remember the routines, the ceremonies, the way everything was measured, controlled.

the bishops were Always there, or maybe i just felt them everywhere.
their voices, commanding, telling you what to do before you even thought it.
i used to believe it was normal, that this was the only way to be. the right way to be.
but the patterns never felt right.

i remember the nights in my room, staring at the ceiling, counting, trying Very hard to breathe,
wondering if anyone else felt the same tightness in their chest.
somE did. some didn’t survive.

i now know vialism is not just a religion, iT’s a prison.
the bishops of dema took it and twisted it, telling everyone that ending tHemselves is the only way to paradisE, the only path to redemption.
every Citizen is forced to live under that doctrine, shaping their life around It, counting down to a faTe they don’t question.
when someone dies, naturally or not, they become what the bishops call the “glorious gone,” vessels for the bishops’ use. 
their bodies are buried under neon gravestones at the citY’s edge, stored until needed.
i’ve seen the whispers about what happens next — in the battle of paladin strait, the bishops raised the glorious gone as weapons, through this seizing thing i don't understand.
it makes my skin crawl to think about it, and it’s why i had to leave.

the forest outside feels endless, but at least it’s alive.
it doesn’t control me. it doesn’t watch me.
it lets me be, even if my own mind won’t.
