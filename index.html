i’m rowan. i know that names don’t mean much here, but i keep one to remember who i am.
trench is huge. they never told anyone how Vast it really is in dema.

every step carries a weight. Inside the city walls, the air felt heavy, almost suffocating. the walls, the rules, the whispers — they all pressed in.
i saw how they controlled people, how the patterns and Instructions shaped them until they forgot themselves. i couldn’t stay.

i stumbled across marks left by others.
scratches, symbols, warnings — and they guided me.
the further i went, the more Alive the place felt, but not in a good way.
it watched me, it tested me.

i noticed carvings: numerals and shapes, Letters interlaced like a code. only careful eyes catch them, and they seemed to spell fragments of warnings.
the whispers urged me forward. i stopped to listen, to understand, but the meaning was clear: staying meant surrender.

inside dema, the bishops practiced something called vialism. i don’t fully understand it, but it twists people. 
it kills them.

the city’s ceremonies were Loud and frightening, echoing through the halls, leaving a mark on anyone who listened.
they drain hope, little by little, until you forget yourself.

that’s why I left. the walls could no longer contain me, and the green beyond promised something freer.

i saw the battle of paladin Strait. it wasn’t just a fight. i knew then that escape was the only choice.

something waiTs at the end of this path.
i’ll probably stop for the night.
