i’m rowan. i know that names don’t mean much here, but i keep one to remember who i am.
trench is huge. they never told anyone how vast it really is in dema.

every step carries a weight. inside the city walls, the air felt heavy, almost suffocating. the walls, the rules, the whispers — they all pressed in.
i saw how they controlled people, how the patterns and rituals shaped them until they forgot themselves. i couldn’t stay.

i stumbled across marks left by others.
scratches, symbols, warnings — and they guided me.
the further i went, the more alive the place felt, but not in a good way. 
it watched me, it tested me.

i noticed carvings: numerals and shapes, letters interlaced like a code. only careful eyes catch them, and they seemed to spell fragments of warnings. 
the whispers urged me forward. i stopped to listen, to understand, but the meaning was clear: staying meant surrender.

inside dema, the bishops practiced something called vialism. i don’t fully understand it, but it twists people. it kills them. that’s why i left.

i saw the battle of paladin strait. it wasn’t just a fight. i knew then that escape was the only choice.

something waits at the end of this path. i'll probably stop for the night.
