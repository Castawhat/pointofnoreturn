<body>
    <pre>
the night doesn’t end.
i can’t sleep. every sound is louder than it should be.
the wind whispers, the trees shift, and the shadows move.

i try to count to calm myself. one, two, three, four… but the numbers fade.
i hear footsteps, but there’s no one there.

the forest feels alive. it watches me, breathing, testing me.
i trace marks in the dirt—circles, scratches, numerals—they are everywhere.

earlier, in dema, someone had handed me a scrap of paper. 
i can’t remember who. 
the words scribbled on it keep running through my head, a fragment of something.
"I'll stay awake,
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight."
it feels like it’s meant for me, or maybe just a reminder that others have felt this same unrest.

i see flickering lights. maybe it’s the banditos.
maybe it’s nothing.
i write, i scratch, i write again, but the words don’t help.

time doesn’t move. the sky doesn’t change.
i can’t escape my own thoughts.
