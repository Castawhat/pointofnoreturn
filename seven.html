i woke up to the sound of branches cracking, though the air around me was still.
something had changed, i know it.

as i walked further, i found another cluster of carvings. these were different from the warnings, almost like someone wanted me to notice.
among them, one phrase stood out, after all it was written seven times.

ZHOSVMVSPUH

i traced it with my hand, over and over. it felt like it wasn’t just random letters, but something important, something waiting to be turned.
maybe a code. maybe a name.

the forest pressed in while i stood there. i could feel eyes watching, but when i turned, nothing. only the endless green.
the whispers followed, closer now. they repeat the phrase when i close my eyes.

i’ll try to make sense of it later. for now, i need to keep moving.
