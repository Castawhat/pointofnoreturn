    <header> <h1>The point of no return</h1> </header>
<body>
    <pre>
the forest thins as i push past the last ridge.
shadows stretch longer, flickering with every gust of wind.

i see them before they see me. figures moving like ghosts through the trees, lean and careful.
their eyes catch the light in a way that makes my skin crawl — sharp, watchful, calculating.
they are the banditos. i thought they were only a myth.

they don’t belong to dema. well, not anymore.
<!--Why are you here? are you trying to find the password? Go away and solve the ARG thing like a real person.-->
i freeze. one steps forward, not noticing me at first. then another, scanning the path behind me.
my instincts tell me: stay low, move slowly, trace their steps, and learn.

i watch their patterns — how they leap across fallen logs, how they avoid certain areas, how they move with precision.
every motion seems like a code, a rhythm, a map.

theres some sort of address carved into a tree, banditonumber4@gmail.com
maybe it will be useful later.
