hey there,
thanks for playing through this little game.
if you made it all the way here and see this, say hi at pointofnoreturn@slitrostudio.me

about rowan:
i needed a name. i tried way too hard to come up with something that felt right.
then i noticed my scissors from school had someone’s name on them: rowan.
that’s where it came from.

about this project:
this was my first time trying something like this, so it’s more of a passion project than anything polished.
i just wanted to experiment, build something strange, and see if it could work.
i ended up shipping it as part of hack club’s summer of making 2025.
(if you have come from hack club/summer of making, feel free to DM me on slack! @Josh [The one with the paperclip])

Thank you. |-/
