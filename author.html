hey there,
thanks for playing through this little game i made. 
if you made it all the way here and see this, say hi at pointofnoreturn@slitrostudio.me


about rowan:
i needed a name. i tried way too hard to come up with something that felt right.
then i noticed my scissors from my old school had someone’s name on them: rowan's.
that’s where it came from.


about this project:
this was my first time trying something like this, so it’s more of a passion project than anything polished.
i just wanted to experiment, build something strange, and see if it could work. i dont know if it did yet.
i ended up shipping it as part of hack club’s summer of making 2025.
(if you have come from hack club/summer of making, feel free to DM me on slack! @Josh [the one with the paperclip])
fun fact: all of rowan's entries were written in pre tags, as it preserves formatting.

let this project serve as an example that you dont need to know alot of code to have fun and make cool stuff.

if you're between 13 and 18:
 join a hack club! there may be one in your area. 
if there isn't check out workshops.hackclub.com and check out some of the workshops!
join the hack club slack too, hackclub.com/slack and become a hack club member! its a lot of fun.

if you're older than 18
check out workshops.hackclub.com and check out some of the workshops!
check out w3schools for the html + css free coding courses. thats how i learnt.

don't be afraid to make.

thank you
